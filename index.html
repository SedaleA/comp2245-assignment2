          <h2>Night City</h2>

            I saw corps transform Night City into a machine fueled by people's
            crushed spirits, broken dreams and emptied pockets. Corps've long
            controlled our lives, taken lots and now they're after our souls!
            I've declared war not 'cause capitalism's a thorn in my side or
            outta nostalgia for an America gone by. This war's a people's war
            against a system that's spiralled outta our control. 
            <p>
                Johnny
            Silverhand, born Robert John Linder, was a famous and influential
            rockerboy and lead singer of the band Samurai before its breakup in
            2008. A military veteran who defined the rockerboy movement as it is
            known today, Silverhand was the most prominent figure who fought
            against the corrupt American government and megacorporations, often
            being described as a terrorist because of this. Despite being
            charismatic and quite the charmer, he was also known to be
            irrational, impulsive, and manipulative.

            When most people think of Arasaka, the picture in their minds is
            that of the blackclad guards employed by so many corporations,
            businesses and powerful individuals throughout the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Arasaka Corporation, is a world-wide megacorporation dealing in corporate security, banking, and manufacturing. It is one of the most influential megacorporations in the world.
            The company is also the largest distributor of Japanese-made merchandise throughout the American, European, and Asian markets. 
            Arasaka-branded weapons and military vehicles are among the most sought after by police and security firms. Over the years, 
            it has developed a dark reputation as a corporation that is to be feared and one which covers its tracks using assassins, an army of lawyers, as well as an alleged connection to the Yakuza
